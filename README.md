# Paint-Box-in-C++
This program will provide a black canvas and a one color paint brush ;p to draw and have fun...
It is a simple study project, I designed it as a project to completely convert it into my customized version of MS-Paint... but never completed it...
I hope, I'll one day complete it.

# How to Run locally
To run the game locally on your system. Just follow the steps:

1. Firstly, download this repository and Unzip it.
2. Now, open the .exe file and enjoy... :)

And if you want to see the code or want to change something just open the .cpp file in any editor and do your work.*

<b>*Note:</b><br>Before compiling the code just make sure that your compiler supports the corresponding hearder files used because the game is based on the late 90's C/C++.
If not, follow the following steps:

1. Open the "Requirements" folder and copy the files named, "graphics.h" and "winbgim.h", and paste them in the "/MinGW/include/" folder.
2. Now, copy the "libbgi.a" and paste it in the "/MinGW/lib/" folder.
3. At last, just copy the following text(also, written in the file, "last step.txt") and paste in the Compiler Linking Setting of your Code Editor.

And Enjoy.
